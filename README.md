# Spree Android Admin APP

The app works with  Spree's RESTful API. You should have a Spree Store set up somewhere. Using this android app, one can add/edit products or view orders on a Spree Store.

For the app to work with your Spree Store make sure you first add the following gem to your store: https://github.com/anoopkanyan/spree_api_auth

Once the store has been set up install the app on your android device using the apk file inside the app directory. Then use your store's URL, admin email and password to login and start interacting with your store.
